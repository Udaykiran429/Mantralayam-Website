                Mantralayam is a significant pilgrimage center located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. It is world-renowned as the final resting place of the 17th-century Vaishnava saint and philosopher, Sri Raghavendra Swamy.<br>

<b>Mantralayam: The Abode of Peace and Devotion</b>
Mantralayam is a sacred town that draws millions of devotees seeking spiritual solace. It is synonymous with the Sri Raghavendra Swamy Mutt, where the saint entered Sajeeva Samadhi (attaining liberation while alive) in 1671.<br>


<b>Key Highlights for Visitors:</b>
The Moola Brindavana: The main attraction is the sacred Samadhi of Sri Raghavendra Swamy. Devotees believe the saint’s spiritual presence will remain in the Brindavana for 700 years to bless his followers.<br>
Manchalamma Temple: Tradition dictates that pilgrims first visit the temple of Goddess Manchalamma, the presiding deity of the village, before entering the main Mutt.<br>
<b>The Tungabhadra River:</b> Many devotees take a holy dip in the river, located just behind the temple complex, before offering their prayers.
Vibrant Rituals: The temple is famous for its daily Annadhanam (free sacred meals) and the majestic Rathotsavam (Chariot Festival), where the deity is taken in a golden or silver chariot.<br>
<b>Best Time to Visit</b>
While the temple is open year-round, the most popular time to visit is during the Raghavendra Swamy Aradhana Mahotsava (usually in August), which celebrates the anniversary of his Samadhi.<br>
<b>How to Reach</b><br>
<b>By Train:</b> The nearest railway station is Mantralayam Road (MALM), located about 16 km from the town.
<b>By Road:</b> It is well-connected by bus services from major cities like Kurnool, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Raichur.<br>
<b>Travel Tip:</b> Ensure you check the temple timings for Darshan, as the shrine usually closes for a few hours in the afternoon.
